# JavaaMuleEC
Java library implementing aMule EC protocol.

This library was basically created for the development of the [Amule Remote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iukonline.amule.android.amuleremote) Android app. However, it can be used within any Java application.

Project is poorly documented (if documented at all), but I have no time at the moment to set up a proper documentation. Feel free to reach out to iuk@iukonline.com for any clarification.

## Distribution ##
