# JavaaMuleEC
Java library implementing aMule EC protocol.

This library was basically created for the development of the [Amule Remote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iukonline.amule.android.amuleremote) Android app. However, it can be used within any Java application. This library was initially developed as copy-righted, but I'm currently going open source and publishing under a GNU GPL license.

Project is poorly documented (if documented at all), but I have no time at the moment to set up a proper documentation. Feel free to reach out to iuk@iukonline.com for any clarification.

### Distribution ###

A pom.xml file is available for compiling and publishing to a local Maven repository. Set environment variable IUKONLINE_MVN_REPO_HOME to match local Maven repo.
